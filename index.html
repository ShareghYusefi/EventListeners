    <h1>Javascript Events</h1>
    <p>
      An event is a signal that something has happened. For example, when a user
      clicks a button, that is an event. Javascript can be used to respond to
      these events.
    </p>
    <p>
      The function that executes when an event occurs is called an event
      handler. Event handlers are used to handle and manage events.
    </p>
    <button onclick="alert('click event triggered')">Click me!</button>
    <button>No event listeners attached to this button</button>
    <button ondblclick="alert('double click event triggered')">
      Double click me!
    </button>
    <button onmouseover="alert('Mouse over event triggered')">
      Mouse over
    </button>

    <button id="special">Special click</button>

    <script>
      // get element by id
      var special = document.getElementById("special");
      // add event listener for the click event
      special.addEventListener("click", function () {
        alert("Special click event triggered");
      });
    </script>
  </body>
